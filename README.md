University Projects
===

This is a repository that hosts different projects written throughout my
computer science education (starting from **2010**). The repository is separated by languages instead of course codes. In each directory, a detailed explanation is given regarding to what the code does.

These projects are not the only ones I did in university. These are only
small subset which I decided to make public.
