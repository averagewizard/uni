COMP 412 Homework II

This section of code describes the design choice for solving the
problem. The original idea of using the stack for pushing the numbers
and popping them after was kept. However, as there will be new type for
floating numbers, a new regular expression was written in calc.l that
recognizes floating point numbers.

The first design did not differentiate between integers and floats in
both lexer and parser. So, union type was added in calc.y and tokens
were marked as either integer or float. So, when lexer recognized an
integer or float, it marked the value accordingly by putting yylval.ival
(for integers), or yylval.fval (for floats).

When we have different types of numbers, a new data structure for
holding them was needed. Thus, number_t was created that holds the type
of the data and the value. Integers are kept as a float in this data
sturcture and they are casted when needed. For example, when T_Int is
seen, the value is cast to float and pushed onto the stack.

So, the stack was needed to be updated that operates on number_t data
structure. Instead of putting simply ints in the stack, number_t is put
on the stack and operated. Instead of calculating the result in the
grammar like (| E E '+' { Push(pop() + pop())}", new functions were
added for the operations. These functions operated on number_t data
structure that distinquish between floating point numbers and integers.
If both of the operands are integers, the resulting number is marked as
integer, however, if either of the operands are floats, the result is
marked as float.

Lastly, new function print_top() was created that shows the result. If
the result coming from calc_* methods is integer, only the integer part
is written. However, if the result is float, the float is printed with
precision of 5 after the dot.

At first, there seems to be code duplication arising from the same
design choice. All of these calc_* methods could be put in one function
that takes another operation function as a parameter and produces
the result. If it were a functional programming language like Racket, it
would be easily done. However, it is a little bit hard to implement this
just to save a few lines of code in C.
