Chat Server
---

Simple and highly extendible chat server and client architecture using pure python sockets.

Window Share
---
Built on top of chat server, window share is a simple scribble-like game. Each
client connects to the server and draws to the screen. The information is, then,
relayed to other clients.

Tk is used to draw the GUI.
