General Information
====
Some implementation examples from **Data Structures and Algorithms** course. The book
used in the course was Cormen's Data Structures and Algorithms.


Sorting Algorithms
----
Implementation, testing, and performance comparison of **Quick Sort**, **Heap Sort**,
and **Cormen's Merge Sort** algorithms. The comparison also includes **insertion sort** and **regular merge sort**, which my professor provided the implementation.

The data is gathered using my own implementation, written into a file, and plotted
using ``gnuplot``.


Binary Tree
----
Extendible, highly documented binary tree implementations with java generics.
The implementations include **Red-Black**, **AVL**, and **Binary Search** trees.
